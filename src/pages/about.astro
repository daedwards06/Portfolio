		<h1>About</h1>
		<p class="muted">A little context on who I am and what I build.</p>
	</header>

	<p>
		I’m {siteConfig.name}, a data scientist focused on building practical machine learning systems —
		especially recommendation and ranking pipelines — and shipping them as usable products.
	</p>

	<p>
		My interest in data science grew from a fascination with how systems can be built to connect people
		with content they genuinely enjoy. Recommendation systems and NLP attract me because they sit at
		the intersection of statistical rigor and real-world user impact — the feedback loop between a
		model's output and a person's experience is immediate and measurable.
	</p>

	<h2>Interests</h2>
	<p>
		Recommendation systems, natural language processing, media and entertainment analytics, and applied
		machine learning — particularly in contexts where evaluation quality and user experience are tightly
		coupled.
	</p>

	<h2>Skills</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Python, SQL</li>
		<li>Experiment design, evaluation, and metrics</li>
		<li>Recommenders (CF, embeddings, hybrid pipelines)</li>
		<li>Deployment-oriented apps (Streamlit) and clean codebases</li>
	</ul>
