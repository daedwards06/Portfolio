A hybrid recommendation engine combining collaborative filtering, content-based similarity, and neural embeddings to recommend anime across a 13,000+ title catalog.

## Why it stands out

- Three-stage scoring pipeline: candidate generation → shortlist → reranking
- Hybrid CF: FunkSVD matrix factorization + item-kNN blending
- Multi-modal content signals: TF-IDF/SVD + neural sentence embeddings
- Explainability and diversity controls in the UI
